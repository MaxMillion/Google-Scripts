This repo is where I'll keep some scripts that are useful to me, and hopefully others can benefit from them too.\r\n\r\n### How to Use Google Scripts\r\n\r\nVisit the [Google Scripts](http://script.google.com) site and create your first script. Scripts are stored in Google Drive, so you can edit them there later on.\r\n\r\nThen just paste this script into a new Script document.\r\n",
